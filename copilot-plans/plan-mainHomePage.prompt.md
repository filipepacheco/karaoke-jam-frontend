## Plan: Main Home Page with Autumn Theme & Simple Hero

This plan outlines the steps to build the main home page for a React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + daisyUI project, using the autumn theme, simple icons, and a straightforward hero section. All requirements from `project-requirements.md` will be referenced, ensuring best practices and compatibility with the tech stack.

### Steps
1. Review `project-requirements.md` for functional, design, and accessibility needs.
2. Configure daisyUI to use the autumn theme in [tailwind.config.js] and ensure theme switching is disabled.
3. Select and document the simplest icon set (e.g., daisyUI built-in or Heroicons) in [README.md] for consistency.
4. Design a minimal hero section in [`src/components/Hero.tsx`] with clear headline, subtext, and call-to-action.
5. Structure the home page layout in [`src/App.tsx`] to include Navbar, Hero, Features, and Footer components.
6. Apply Tailwind CSS and daisyUI classes for autumn colors, spacing, and responsiveness in all components.
7. Ensure accessibility (a11y) and semantic HTML in all sections per requirements.
8. Document design choices and usage instructions in [README.md] for future reference.

### Further Considerations
1. Should the hero section include an image or remain text-only for simplicity?
2. Confirm icon set preference: daisyUI default, Heroicons, or another minimal set.
3. Review `daisy.txt` and `tailwind.txt` for any additional style or component guidelines.
